# truck - Truck is a rust CAD kernel

‚Ä‚·‚Ä‚·‚Ä‚·‚Æ

## Overview

Truck is an open-source shape processing kernel by Rust.  
The broad concept consists of the following three elements.

- Trendy Tools
- Traditional Arts
- Theseus' ship

### Trendy Tools

- We are targeting the next generation of market share using developmental tools: Rust and WebGPU.
- Advanced optimizations using Rust and WebGPU maximize the performance of each crate.

### Traditional Arts

- We will break away from the legacy by re-implementing the B-rep with NURBS in the above trendy tools.
- Safe implementation using Rust to eliminate core dumped for CPU-derived processes.
- Cargo's extensive maintenance features ensure thorough continuous integration.

### Theseus' ship

- We are modularizing into smaller crates that can be replaced, like [the Ship of Teseus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ship_of_Theseus).
- Based on the many lessons learned in the past, we have given up on overall optimization as a single application, and design as a collection of individual optimized crates.
- Since unexpected expansions are bound to occur, we deal with uncontrolled expansions in the form of small modules.

## Usage

### How to Run Examples

All examples are located under the examples directory in each crates.  
These examples use the default syntax for running examples, as found in the [Cargo](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/reference/cargo-targets.html#examples) documentation.

At first, let's run the following example!

```bash
git submodule update --init
cargo run --example rotate-objects
```

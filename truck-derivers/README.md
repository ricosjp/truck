# truck-derivers

Defines derive macros for implementing geometric traits.

The macros defined here are re-exported by `truck-geotrait`, so users do not need to depend on this crate directly.
To use the macros used in this crate, activate the feature `derive` in `truck-geotrait`.

```toml
truck-geotrait = { version = "0.3.0", features = ["derive"] }
```
